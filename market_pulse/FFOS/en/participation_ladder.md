# Market Research Participation Ladder


There are three levels of participation, ranging from our first set of most critical research needs, leading into deeper evaluations of market through storytelling, and outreach.  Each of these priorities have their own training module, and each will be released as an 'activity' in coming months.  Currently we are focused on the first activity. 

** You can [sign-up for notification of new activities here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1RLcSS9r1i-gMig1hRBg6gb86VWspvsan5OVdpfRWT-M/viewform?usp=send_form) **

Al participation levels include recognition for participants as tracked and announced by the Market Pulse Team.

Most critical for the short-term success of Firefox OS Market Research, and our Market Research Impact Team is the collection of local pricing for FFOS.  The [Market Pulse Web App](https://marketpulse.mozilla.community/] web app will make it easy to collect FFOS data for:

* Web Stores
* Local Stores   

And for a a diversity of pricing, which might include:

* Phones bundled as part of a sales package
* Individual Prices
* Individual Sale Prices

**Recognition:** 

All participants who successfully collect phone prices for 3 months are recognized with your preference of a FFOS Data Collection Badge or a Printable Certificate.

Top 3 contributors as determined by the Market Research Team, will recieve a Marketplace T-Shirt.
